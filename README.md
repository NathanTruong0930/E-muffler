Exhaust System for Electric Vehicles
This project aims to enhance the driving experience of electric vehicles by creating a system that mimics the sound of a traditional car engine. While electric vehicles are known for their quiet operation, some drivers miss the auditory feedback that comes with accelerating and driving. Our solution is a customizable exhaust system that produces realistic engine sounds and visually engages the user with LED indicators.

At the heart of the system is a custom-designed circuit board (PCB) that integrates key components like speakers, LEDs, touch sensors, and a throttle positioning sensor. The sounds are stored on a microSD card and played through dual speakers. One speaker produces a constant background hum, while the other changes its volume based on the throttle position, simulating acceleration. The system also features LED lights to indicate power status and track selection.

The exhaust system is user-friendly and easy to control. A touch sensor lets the user turn the system on and off, while another sensor allows switching between different engine sound profiles. The LED lights indicate whether the system is on and show which sound profile is currently active. Powered by a standard 9V battery, the entire setup is compact enough to fit inside an exhaust-like enclosure, making it ideal for integration into an electric vehicle.

This project combines practical engineering with creativity, offering a solution that balances the silence of electric vehicles with the sensory experience of traditional cars. Whether youâ€™re a car enthusiast or just someone looking for a fun way to personalize your EV, this exhaust system brings sound and style to the future of driving.
